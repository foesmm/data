<DLC Title="Lonesome Road">
    <Description>Lonesome Road brings the Courier's story full circle when you are contacted by the original Courier
        Six, a man by the name of Ulysses who refused to deliver the platinum chip at the start of New Vegas. In his
        transmission, Ulysses promises the answer as to why, but only if you take one last jobâ€”a job that leads you into
        the depths of the hurricane-swept canyons of The Divide, a landscape torn apart by earthquakes and violent
        storms. The road to the Divide is a long and treacherous one, and of the few to ever walk the road, none have
        ever returned.
