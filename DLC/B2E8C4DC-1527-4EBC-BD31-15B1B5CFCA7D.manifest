<DLC Title="Old World Blues">
    <Description>In Old World Blues you'll discover how some of the Mojave's mutated monsters, such as night stalkers
        and cazadores, came to be when you unwittingly become a human experiment at the hands of five pre-War doctors.
        You'll need to scour the research centers of Big MT in search of powerful weapons to join forces with them
        against Dr. Mobius, who seeks to destroy all their experiments - or use the technology to get revenge on them
        for abducting you. You are the only hope of saving the "Think Tank" and all of Science! - but the question is:
        is Big MT really what it seems?
